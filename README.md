# Heart_Health_Monitoring
The project focuses on the development of an IoT-based ECG monitoring system designed for heart health monitoring and disease detection. The primary goal of this initiative is to create a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates data visualization and analysis capabilities through the utilization of Blynk. This project yields several significant outcomes, including real-time monitoring, seamless data analysis, and disease detection.

The real-time monitoring aspect of the system provides a mechanism for continuous ECG monitoring, allowing for the early identification of heart-related issues. By leveraging Blynk, the project ensures the smooth visualization and analysis of collected data, granting quick insights into the user's heart health. Moreover, the system is adept at detecting abnormalities in ECG signals, thereby contributing to the early diagnosis of heart diseases. This capability enhances the potential to detect conditions such as cholesterol clogging, heart attacks, past heart attacks, one-sided heart enlargement, and abnormal heart rhythms, providing a valuable tool for managing and preventing cardiovascular health issues. Overall, the project represents a significant step toward enhancing the early diagnosis and monitoring of heart-related conditions, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes for individuals with high blood pressure and other risk factors.
