# IoT-Based ECG Monitoring System

## Overview

The project focuses on the development of an IoT-based ECG monitoring system designed for heart health monitoring and disease detection. The primary goal of this initiative is to create a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates data extraction and ECG display through the utilization of Blynk. The collected ECG data is intended for further analysis using machine learning algorithms to detect abnormalities in ECG signals.

## Key Features

- Real-time ECG data monitoring and display.
- Integration with Blynk for remote monitoring and control.
- Data extraction and preprocessing for machine learning analysis.
- Abnormality detection in ECG signals using ML algorithms.

## Project Outcome

This project yields several significant outcomes, including real-time monitoring of ECG data, enabling users to remotely access and visualize their heart health information. Furthermore, it offers the potential for early detection of heart-related abnormalities, which can be crucial for timely medical intervention.
